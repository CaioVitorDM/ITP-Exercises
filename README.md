# PTI - Exercises

This is a repository for the exercises developed at the class named Programming Techniques Introduction (PTI).
I attended this class on the second semester at IMD/UFRN, there we learned to work with C and started implementing
and working with some things like structs, vectors, "strings", memory management, etc.

To compile any of these programs you can use the following command line at your terminal:

```gcc -o output_name_u_want program_name.c```
