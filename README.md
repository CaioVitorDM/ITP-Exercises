# PTI - Projects

This is a repository for the exercises developed at the class named Programming Techniques Introduction (PTI).
I attended this class at the second semester at IMD/UFRN, there we learned to work with C and started implementing
and working with some things like structs, vectors, "strings", memory management, etc.
